Mass Media - Pro Palestine Encampments on College Campuses

--

    This October, the Israel-Palestine conflict re-entered the public eye in a firery rage with Hamas attacking at the Gaza Strip. Since then, unlike ever before, first-hand accounts of the atrocities coming from Israel and Palestine have been plastered all over social media. Along with these disturbing images comes the outrage of millions---politically-oriented young men and women condemning what Israel is doing to the Palestinian people. But, the outrage is not contained to social media warriors. Now, college campuses have been subject to Pro-Palestinian encampments with student activists who are protesting in solidarity for the people of Palestine.
