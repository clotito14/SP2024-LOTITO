> Q4: Based on your understanding of semiconductor manufacturing, write 3 multiple choice questions.

### Q1: If you're looking to start making silicon semiconductors, from what two groups on the periodic table will you choose atoms for your n-type and p-type semiconductor regions?

    (A) N-TYPE: GROUP 13, P-TYPE: GROUP 14
    (B) N-TYPE: GROUP 14, P-TYPE: GROUP 15
    (C) N-TYPE: GROUP 15, P-TYPE: GROUP 13
    (D) N-TYPE: GROUP 16, P-TYPE: GROUP 12
    [ANS: C]

### Q2: Semiconductor manufacturing is both an additive and subtractive process. For the subtractive part, what steps are taken to reveal devices on a silicon wafer?

    (A) 1. Si02 Layer, 2. Photoresist, 3. Expose through Photomask, 4. Plasma etch.
    (B) 1. Pure Si layer, 2. Photoresist, 3. Expose through Photomask, 4. Plasma etch.
    (C) 1. Si02 Layer, 2. Photoresist and expose 3. Plasma etch, 4. Ion implant exposed regions
    (D) 1. Si02 Layer, 2. Photomask, 3. Machine away template, 4. Chemically smooth machining impurities
    [ANS: A, not C since last is additive]

### Q3: There are many ways to test if a semiconductor device was manufactured properly. What are tools or methods that are used in the testing process?

    (A) Electron microscopy.
    (B) Sputtering machines.
    (C) Clean rooms.
    (D) Ion implantation.
    [ANS: A]
