## A. Questions
1. Differences between substrates and epitaxial wafers?
2. 

## 0. IMPORTANT TERMINOLOGY
 
1. EPITAXY - a type of crystal growth or material deposition in which new crystalline layers are fomred with one or more well-defined orientations with respect to the crystalline seed layer. (homo for growth same as seed, hetero for growth different as seed).

2. HALIDE VAPOR PHASE EPITAXY (HVPE) - A non-organic chemical vapor deposition, characterized by high quality growth of epitaxial layers with fast growth rate. 

3. ATOMIC LAYER DEPOSITION (ALD) -

4. HIGH-ELECTRON-ELECTRON MOBILITY TRANSISTORS (HEMTs)

5. CRITICAL ELECTRIC FIELD (Ec) - The maximum electric field strength above which elctrons in a collisional plasma can be accelerated to become runaway electrons.

6. ULTRA WIDE BAND GAP (UWBG)

7. POWER FIGURE OF MERIT (PFOM)

8. BALIGA HIGH-FREQUENCY FIGURE OF MERIT - Predicts power losses for a power device will increase as the square root of operating frequency and is proportional to the output power. Power losses can be reduced using semiconductors with larger mobility and larger critical electric field for breakdown.

9. ON RESISTANCE (Ron) - The resistance between the source and drain of a MOSFET during operation. Ron leads to power losses in heat. Generally, the larger the chip size, the smaller the on resistance.

10. EDGE-DEFINED FILM-FED GROWTH (EFG)

11. CZOCHRALSKI METHOD (CZ)

12. MOLECULAR BEAM EPITAXY (MBE)

13. METAL ORGANIC CHEMICAL VAPOR DEPOSITION (MOCVD)

14. VERTICAL BRIDGMAN METHOD (VB)

15. FLOATING ZONE METHOD (FZ)

16. MONOCLINIC CRYSTAL SYSTEM - The crystal is described by 3 vectors of unequal lengths, with 2 perpendicular.

## IV. ECONOMIC MODEL

What affects the economic model for B-Ga203 for power-devices?
    1. Price per unit current (wafer price and current density)

B-Ga203's Baliga FOM is higher than that of SiC and GaN.
    -> Due to B-Ga203 bulk growth.
    -> The on-resistance is expected to be reduced for transistors and diodes, THEREFORE, current density can be increased for the same voltage.

### 1. SUBSTRATES

CHALLENGE 1: LOSS OF PRECIOUS METAL CRUCIBLES IN EFG AND CZ.
    -> Iridium is used for crucible (low 02)
        -> Small amounts of Ga react with Ir during casting (loss).
        -> This is exacerbated for larger growths bc more Ga.
        -> Higher temps also increase this reaction.
    -> VB method can control temps better and cause less of this reaction.
        -> Lower temps (better concentrated).
        -> High 02 levels, so use Pt-Rh alloy crucible.
        -> Crucible still needs recasting.

CHALLENGE 2: INCREASE SUBSTRATES IN WAFER FABRICATION
    -> Thickness of substrate must be reduced.
    -> B-Ga203 can be cleaved on (100) and (001) planes
        -> xz-plane and xy-plane.
    -> B-Ga203 has crystal structure of a monoclinic system with low symmetry, THEREFORE high accuracy is needed.

The commerically available crystallographic planes for B-Ga203 are (100) (010) and (001). 

CHALLENGE 3: SUBSTRATE WASTE THROUGH MATERIAL SCRAPING
    -> During Chemical Mechanical Polishing (CMP), it is necessary to remove a region thicker than the damaged layer generated in the previous step. WASTEFUL.

Intrinsic Material Properties
    1. Transport (isotropic)
    2. Thermal conductivity (anisotropic)
    3. Field strength (anisotropic)
